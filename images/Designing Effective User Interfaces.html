<p>
by Suzanne Martin
</p><p>


The use of typography, symbols, color, and other static and dynamic graphics
are used to convey facts, concepts and emotions.  This makes up an
information-oriented, systematic graphic design which helps people understand
complex information.  Successful visual communication through
information-oriented, systematic graphic design relies on some key principles
of graphic design.
</p><p>


</p><h2>Design Considerations</h2>

There are three factors that should be considered for the design of a
successful user interface; development factors, visability factors and
acceptance factors.
<p>
Development factors help by improving visual communication.  These
include: platform constraints, tool kits and component libraries, support
for rapid prototyping, and customizability.
</p><p>
Visability factors take into account human factors and express a strong
visual identity.  These include: human abilities, product identity, clear
conceptual model, and multiple representations.
</p><p>
Included as acceptance factors are an installed base, corporate politics,
international markets, and documentation and training.
</p><p>


</p><h2>Visible Language</h2>

Visible language refers to all of the graphical techniques used to communicate
the message or context.  These include:
<ul>
<li> Layout: formats, proportions, and grids; 2-D and 3-D organization
</li><li> Typography: selection of typefaces and typesetting, including variable
        width and fixed width
</li><li> Color and Texture: color, texture and light that convey complex
        information and pictoral reality
</li><li> Imagery: signs, icons and symbols, from the photographically real to the
        abstract
</li><li> Animation: a dynamic or kinetic display; very important for
        video-related imagery
</li><li> Sequencing: the overall approach to visual storytelling
</li><li> Sound: abstract, vocal, concrete, or musical cues
</li><li> Visual identity: the additional, unique rules that lend overall
        consistency to a user interface.  The overall decisions as to how the
        corporation or the product line expresses itself in visible language.
</li></ul>
<p>


</p><h2>Principles of User Interface Design</h2>

There are three fundamental principles involved in the use of the visible
language.
<ul>
<li> Organize: provide the user with a clear and consistent conceptual
        structure
</li><li> Economize: do the most with the least amount of cues
</li><li> Communicate: match the presentation to the capabilities of the user.
</li></ul>
<p>

</p><h3>Organize</h3>

Consistency, screen layout, relationships and navigability are important
concepts of organization.<p>

</p><pre><img src="./Designing Effective User Interfaces_files/chaotic.gif"> <img src="./Designing Effective User Interfaces_files/ordered.gif"><br>
<cite>     Example: Chaotic Screen                  Example: Ordered Screen</cite>
<br><br><br>
</pre>
<p>

</p><h4>Consistency</h4>
There are four views of consistency: internal consistency, external
consistency, real-world consistency, and when not to be consistent.
<p>
The first point, internal consistency states the same conventions and rules
should be applied to all elements of the GUI.
</p><p>
</p><pre>     <img src="./Designing Effective User Interfaces_files/intconst.gif" alt="[dialogue boxes]"><p>
<cite>     Example: Internal Consistency - Dialogue Boxes<br></cite>
     Same kinds of elements are shown in the same places.<br>
     Those with different kinds of behavior have their<br>
     own special appearance.<br>
<br><br><br>
</p></pre>
<p>

External consistency, the second point, says the existing platforms and
cultural conventions should be followed across user interfaces.
</p><p>
</p><pre>          <img src="./Designing Effective User Interfaces_files/extconst.gif" alt="[text tool icons]"><p>
<cite>     Example: External Consistency for Text Tool Icons</cite>
     These icons come from different desktop publishing<br>
     applications but generally have the same meaning.<br>
<br><br><br>
</p></pre>
<p>

Real-world consistency means conventions should be made consistent with
real-world experiences, observations and perceptions of the user.
</p><p>
</p><pre>        <img src="./Designing Effective User Interfaces_files/rwconst.gif" alt="[Highway signs for icons]"><p>
<cite>          Example: Real-World Consistency
<br><br><br>
</cite></p></pre>
<p>

The last point, innovation, deals with when not to be consistent.  Deviating
from existing conventions should only be done if it provides a clear benefit
to the user.
</p><p>

</p><h4>Screen Layout</h4>
Three ways to design display spatial layout: use a grid structure, standardize
the screen layout, and group related elements.
<p>
A grid structure can help locate menues, dialogue boxes or control panels.
Generally 7 +/-2 is the maximum number of major horizontal or vertical
divisions.  This will help make the screen less cluttered and easier to
understand.
</p><p>

</p><h4>Relationships</h4>
Linking related items and disassociating unrelated items can help achieve
visual organization.
<p>
</p><pre><img src="./Designing Effective User Interfaces_files/relat_l.gif"> <img src="./Designing Effective User Interfaces_files/relat_r.gif"><br>
<cite>                   Example: Relationships</cite>
Left:  Shape, location, and value can all create strong visual<br>
       relationships which may be inappropriate.<br>
Right: Clear, consistent, appropriate, and strong relationships.<br>
<br><br><br>
</pre>
<p>


</p><h4>Navigability</h4>
There are three important navigation techniques:
    - provide an initial focus for the viewer's attention
    - direct attention to important, secondary, or peripheral items
    - assist in navigation throughout the material.
<p>
</p><pre><img src="./Designing Effective User Interfaces_files/navig_l.gif"> <img src="./Designing Effective User Interfaces_files/navig_r.gif"><br> 
<cite>                      Example: Navigation</cite>
LEFT:  Poor design.
RIGHT: Improved design; spatial layout and color help focus viewer's<br>
       attention to most important titlebar areas.  Bulleted items<br>
       guide the viewer through the secondary contents.<br>
<br><br><br>
</pre>
<p>


</p><h3>Economize</h3>

Four major points to be considered: simplicity, clarity, distinctiveness, and
emphasis.


<h4>Simplicity</h4>
Simplicity includes only the elements that are most important for
communication.  It should also be as unobstrusive as possible.
<p>
</p><pre>     <img src="./Designing Effective User Interfaces_files/comsimp.gif"><br>
<cite>         Example: Complicated and Simpler Designs</cite>
<br><br><br>
</pre>
<p>

</p><h4>Clarity</h4>
All components should be designed so their meaning is not ambiguous.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><pre>     <img src="./Designing Effective User Interfaces_files/clarity.gif"><br>
<cite>        Example: Ambiguous and Clear Icons</cite>
<br><br><br>
</pre>
<p>

</p><h4>Distinctiveness</h4>
The important properties of the necessary elements should be distinguishable.
<p>

</p><h4>Emphasis</h4>
The most important elements should be easily perceived.  Non-critical elements
should be de-emphasized and clutter should be minimized so as not to hide
critical information.
<p>


</p><h3>Communicate</h3>

The GUI must keep in balance legibility, readability, typography, symbolism,
multiple views, and color or texture in order to communicate successfully.
<p>
</p><pre>         <img src="./Designing Effective User Interfaces_files/il_leg.gif"><br>
<cite>         Example: Illegible and Legible Texts</cite>
<br><br><br><br>
</pre>
<p>

Readability: display must be easy to identify and interpret, should also be
appealing and attractive.
</p><p>
</p><pre><cite>  Example: Unreadable and Readable Texts:</cite>
<tt>
           Unreadable: Design components to be<br>
          easy to interpret and understand.  Design<br>
                 components to be inviting<br>
                     and attractive.<br>
</tt><p>
          <b>Readable</b><br>
          Design components to be easy to<br>
          interpret and understand.<br>

          Design components to be inviting<br>
          and attractive.<br>


</p></pre>
<p>

Typography: includes characteristics of individual elements (typefaces and
typestyles) and their groupings (typesetting techniques).  A small number of
typefaces which must be legible, clear, and distinctive (i.e., distinguish
between different classes of information) should be used.

Recommendations: - maximum of 3 typefaces in a maximum of 3 point sizes
                - a maximum of 40-60 characters per line of text
                - set text flush left and numbers flush right.  Avoid centered
                    text in lists and short justified lines of text
                - use upper and lower case characters whenever possible.
</p><p>

<cite>      Example: Recommended typefaces and typestyles</cite>
<br><br><br>
</p></pre>
<p>

Multiple Views: provide multiple perspectives on the display of complex
structures and processes.

Make use of these multiple views: - multiple forms of representation
                                  - multiple levels of abstraction
                                  - simultaneous alternative views
                                  - links and cross references
                                  - metadata, metatext, metagraphics.

</p><h2>Color</h2>

Color is one of the most complex elements in achieving successful visual
communication.  Used correctly, it can be a powerful tool for communication.
Colors should be combined so they make visual sense.
<p>
Some advantages for using color to help communication:
  - emphasize important information
  - identify subsystems of structures
  - portray natural objects in a realistic manner
  - portray time and progress
  - reduce errors of interpretation
  - add coding dimensions
  - increase comprehensibility
  - increase believability and appeal
</p><p>
When color is used correctly, people will often learn more.  Memory for color
information seems to be much better than information presented in black-and-white.
</p><p>
There are some disadvantages for using color:
  - requires more expensive and complicated display equipment
  - many not accommodate color-deficient vision
  - some colors can potentially cause visual discomfort and afterimages.
  - may contribute to visual or may lead to negative associations through
     cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural association.
</p><p>


</p><h2>Color Design Principles</h2>

The three basic principles can also be applied to color: color organization,
color economy, and color communication.
<p>
Color organization pertains to consistency of organization.  Color should be
used to group related items.  A consistent color code should be applied to
screen displays, documentation, and training materials.
</p><p>
Similar colors should infer a similarity among objects.  One needs to be
complete and consistent when grouping objects by the same color.  Once a color
coding scheme has been established, the same colors should be used throughout
the GUI and all related publications.
</p><p>
The second principle of color, color economy, suggests using a maximum of
5+/-2 colors where the meaning must be remembered.  The fundamental idea is
to use color to augment black-and-white information, i.e. design the display
to first work well in black-and-white.
</p><p>
Color emphasis suggests using strong contrasts in value and chroma to draw
the user's attention to the most important information.  Confusion can result
if too many figures or background fields compete for the viewer's attention.
The hierarchy of highlighted, neutral, and low-lighted states for all areas
of the visual display must be designed carefully to provide the maximum
simplicity and clarity.
</p><p>
Color communication deals with legibility, including using appropriate colors
for the central and peripheral areas of the visual field.  Color combinations
influenced least by the relative area of each color should be used.
</p><p>
Red or green should not be used in the periphery of the visual field, but in
the center.  If used in the periphery, you need a way to capture the attention
of the viewer, size change or blinking for example.  Blue, black, white, and
yellow should be used near the periphery of the visual field, where the retina
remains sensitive to these colors.
</p><p>
If colors change in size in the imagery, the following should be considered:
as color areas decrease in size, their value (lightness) and chroma will appear
to change.
</p><p>
Use colors that differ in both chroma and value.  Avoid red/green, blue/yellow,
green/blue, and red/blue combinations unless a special visual effect is needed.
They can create vibrations, illusions of shadows, and afterimages.
</p><p>
For dark viewing situations, light text, then lines, and small shapes on medium
to dark backgrounds should be used in slide presentations, workstations and videos.
For light-viewing situations, use dark (blue or black) text, thin lines and small
shapes on light background.  These viewing situations include overhead
transparencies and paper.
</p><p>


</p><h2>Color Symbolism</h2>

The importance of color is to communicate.  Therefore color codes should
respect existing cultural and professional usage.

Connotations vary strongly among different kinds of viewers, especially from
different cultures.  Color connotations should be used with great care.  For
example: mailboxes are blue in the United States, bright red in England and bright
yellow in Greece.  If using color in an electronic mail icon on the screen, color
sets might be changed for different countries to reflect the differences in
international markets.
<p>



</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>

Developing better visual (color or black-and-white) communication is an
important part of making computer graphics that communicate effectively and
efficiently through graphic design.
